/**
 * Weekly rebuild for the race diary.
 *
 * The diary is worked out at build time from `new Date()`, so without a
 * rebuild it freezes: past races stop dropping off and the twelve-month window
 * stops rolling. That is exactly how the old hand-maintained calendar died, so
 * this removes the person from the loop.
 *
 * A deploy hook is a URL that starts a build when it receives a POST. Nothing
 * here knows anything about the site — it just rings the bell.
