# Weekly rebuild

The race diary is worked out at build time. Without a rebuild it freezes: races
that have already happened stop dropping off, and the twelve-month window stops
rolling forward. This Worker rings a deploy hook once a week so that happens on
its own — which is what stops the diary lapsing the way the old hand-maintained
calendar did.

It is a separate Worker from the site and shares nothing with it. Twenty lines,
in `src/index.js`.

## How it is set up

Done already, in the Cloudflare dashboard. Recorded here so the next person can
see the shape of it, and rebuild it if it is ever lost.

1. **A deploy hook on the `crr-website` Worker**, under **Settings → Builds →
   Deploy hooks**, pointed at `main`. A deploy hook is a secret URL that starts
   a build when it receives a POST — anyone holding it can start builds, so it
   is treated as a password.
2. **This Worker, named `diary-rebuild`**, created under **Workers & Pages →
   Create application** with the `Smellyllama/crr-website` repository connected
   and **Root directory** set to `workers/diary-rebuild`. Cloudflare builds this
   folder on its own machines and reads the `wrangler.jsonc` here, so the weekly
   schedule travels with the code.
3. **The deploy hook URL stored as a secret** on this Worker, under **Settings →
   Variables and Secrets**, named `DEPLOY_HOOK_URL`. The code refuses to run
   without it — a missing secret throws rather than logging quietly, so a
   half-finished setup fails loudly instead of looking healthy for months.

**`name` in `wrangler.jsonc` must match the Worker's name in the dashboard.**
Wrangler deploys to whatever the file says, and a mismatch is not an error: it
creates a second, different Worker and leaves the real one — the one holding the
secret — untouched and never running. The dashboard flags this if the two drift.

One side effect of connecting the repository: every push to `main` rebuilds this
Worker as well as the site. Harmless, and it builds in seconds, but it shows up
as a second build every time.

## Checking it works

The first scheduled run is the Monday after setup, 06:00 UTC. Two ways to see
it:

- **In the dashboard** — this Worker's **Logs** tab. A successful run logs
  "Rebuild requested" with the time. A failure throws, so it appears as an
  error rather than passing silently. Cross-check against the `crr-website`
  Worker's build list: a build should appear a moment after.
- **From a terminal** — `npx wrangler tail diary-rebuild` shows the same thing
  live.

To test without waiting for Monday, from this directory:

```
npx wrangler dev --test-scheduled
```

then visit `http://localhost:8787/__scheduled` in a browser. Note that this
fires a *real* rebuild if `DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` is set locally.

## Changing the schedule

`triggers.crons` in `wrangler.jsonc` — standard cron syntax, always UTC.
Currently `0 6 * * 1`: Mondays at 06:00, so the week opens with a current diary.

It can also be changed in the dashboard under **Settings → Triggers → Cron
Triggers**, but prefer the file, so the schedule stays written down in the
repository rather than living only somewhere nobody thinks to look.

Weekly is enough. The diary only moves when a month rolls over, and an edit
through the CMS already triggers its own build.

## Deploying from a terminal instead

Only needed if the repository connection is ever removed. From this directory:

```
npx wrangler secret put DEPLOY_HOOK_URL
```

```
npx wrangler deploy
```
